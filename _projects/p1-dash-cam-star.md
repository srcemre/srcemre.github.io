Developed a free, ad-free mobile app that turns smartphones into dashcams with AI-powered object detection for city and traffic signs. The app features loop recording, background operation, and minimal data usage. The application utilizes the TensorFlow Lite model for real-time traffic sign detection and also collects their locations.
