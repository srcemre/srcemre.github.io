Welcome to the **srcemre.github.io** repository!

This repository hosts [my personal blog site](https://emresarac.com.tr) , created using Jekyll. Here, you can find a collection of my experiences, latest projects, and insightful blog posts.

## Technologies Used

**Jekyll**: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal sites and blogs. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. Jekyll is highly customizable, allowing you to create a site that perfectly matches your vision. With its powerful templating engine and support for various plugins, Jekyll makes managing and publishing content easy and efficient.

**GitHub Pages**: GitHub Pages is a service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. It integrates seamlessly with Jekyll, making it easy to deploy your site and keep it updated. By simply pushing your Jekyll site to a GitHub repository, GitHub Pages automatically builds and hosts the site for you, ensuring that your content is always live and accessible.
