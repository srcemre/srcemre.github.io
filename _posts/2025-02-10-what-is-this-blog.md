## What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a popular static site generator used for creating blogs and static websites. Jekyll allows you to write your content in Markdown or HTML and then converts these into static HTML files. This makes your site fast and secure since it doesn't need to pull data dynamically from a database.

### Advantages of Jekyll
**Simple Setup**: Easily installed with Ruby.
**Markdown Support**: Writing content in Markdown makes formatting easy.
**Themes and Plugins**: Extensive support for themes and plugins allows you to personalize your site.
**GitHub Pages Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitHub Pages for easy publishing.

## How to Create a Blog Site with Jekyll
### 1. Install Jekyll and Necessary Tools
First, we need to install Jekyll and Bundler. Open your terminal and run the following commands:
```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
```
### 2. Create a New Jekyll Site
To create a new Jekyll site, use the command:
```sh
jekyll new my-awesome-blog
cd my-awesome-blog
```
### 3. Run the Site Locally
To run the site locally:
```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
You can now view your site in your browser at http://localhost:4000.

### 4. Adding Content
#### Create a New Post
Navigate to the _posts directory and create a new Markdown file. The filename should follow this format: YYYY-MM-DD-title.md.

For example: 2024-06-20-my-first-post.md

The content of the file could be:

```sh

```sh

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial blog setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
```
